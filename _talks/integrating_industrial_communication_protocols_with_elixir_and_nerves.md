A look inside a common problem for startups when developing products focused on the industrial environment: how to interact with industrial devices.
 
First, we will discuss the problem along with a brief introduction to industrial communication protocols, covering their importance and features. Then, we will talk about our experience and workflow for adopting such industrial protocols in Elixir, focusing particularly on OPC UA with a demo. Finally, we will cover the state of the art of open source projects that support several Industrial protocols, as well as future work.
