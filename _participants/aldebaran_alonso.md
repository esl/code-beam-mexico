I’m an Embedded Systems Engineer at Valiot, where I daily do what I like, making hardware to work by digging as much as possible to know the problem until it reaches the bare metal. Basically, I’m part of the hardware & software design team; specifically in the design of the Edge device. Prior to joining Valiot, I worked in different Startups by designing embedded systems for intelligent lighting equipment and before this, it was my bioengineering phase, where I was involved with biological signal processing for the development of brain-machine interfaces.
