While at a desk Raúl spends time learning about the BEAM and getting into programming rabbit-holes. He would like programs to tell you more, especially when they go wrong, has spent his last elixir years on the look for contracts and type systems.

While out of a desk he enjoys weird solo-videogames and owns a collection of historical boardgames; loves trying out traditional food; has a small family with his wife, baby daughter and cat. 

Operates from Tijuana, México where he was born and lives.
