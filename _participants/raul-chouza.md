While at a desk Raúl spends time learning about the BEAM and its ecosystem; he enjoys learning about the nuances of programming and would like programs to tell you more, especially when they go wrong.

Otherwise, he’s a recent dad; enjoys solo videogames and exploring boardgame simulations; loves trying out traditional food and having friends over dinner. Operates from Tijuana, México where he was born and lives.
