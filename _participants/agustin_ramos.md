I'm a professional software developer with 20+ years of experience in different roles. Nominally I have worked as a programmer, technical leader, architect and coach in the development of strategic services, product lines and product families for world wide organizations, mainly in the entertainment, healthcare and national security domains. I'm a frequent speaker at local conferences and developer groups, advocating and showcasing topics as varied as effective modularization techniques, software craftsmanship, software archaeology, functional programming, intelligent and automated testing, product line development and designing for system's scalability.
