Unsure if Elixir distribution is for you? Not sold on the benefits? 

This talk will walk you through the pros and cons of connecting your nodes and building features in top of the disterl functionality built into the Erlang VM. 

Youâ€™ll learn about some of the tricks for maximising the value you get out of clusters, as well as the pitfalls to avoid. 

You should come away with a deeper understanding of this under-utilised gem and ready to build some cool things with it.
